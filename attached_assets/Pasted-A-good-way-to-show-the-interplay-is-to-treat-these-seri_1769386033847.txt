A good way to show the interplay is to treat these series as a pipeline (stock/flow) system and visualize it in two complementary views:

a single “Pipeline Dashboard” tile that tells the story at a glance, and

an optional “identity check” view that helps you diagnose why inventory/supply is moving (starts vs completions vs sales).

Below are the structures that work best in practice.

1) Pipeline view: “Flow + Stock” in one tile (best for decision-making)
A. Two stacked charts (same x-axis)

Top chart (Flows):

Permits (SF) – leading indicator of intent

Starts (SF) – production initiation

New Home Sales (SF) – absorption / demand pull
Use lines (not bars) and index them for comparability:

Either YoY % for all three, or

Index = 100 at a chosen date (e.g., 2019=100) so you see lead/lag cleanly.

Bottom chart (Stocks):

Homes Under Construction (SF) (stock)

Optionally New Homes for Sale / Inventory (stock)
Show as lines in levels (thousands).

Why this works:

Top chart shows momentum and sequencing (permits → starts → sales).

Bottom chart shows where the backlog is building or clearing.

B. Add a derived “backlog pressure” line (high value)

Compute and overlay (on the bottom chart or as a small KPI):

Under Construction / Sales (months of pipeline)

Think of it like “months of work in process” given current demand.

Alternatively: Starts – Sales (flow gap) smoothed 3M MA

Positive = pipeline building; negative = pipeline clearing.

This single derived measure usually explains most “why” questions.

2) Identity check view: explain the stock change mechanically (best for diagnosis)

There’s a basic accounting identity:

Under Construction(t) = Under Construction(t-1) + Starts(t) – Completions(t)

And separately, inventory pressure is influenced by:

For Sale Inventory dynamics ≈ Completions(t) – Sales(t) (simplified)

So you can build a diagnostic tile that shows:

A. “Δ Under Construction” decomposition

Line: Under Construction (level)

Bars: Starts – Completions (monthly net additions to WIP)

Optional: plot Δ Under Construction vs Starts – Completions to show they track.

B. “Market clearing” decomposition

Line: New Homes for Sale (inventory) or Months Supply

Bars: Completions – Sales (net additions to for-sale inventory)

Why this works:

When users ask “inventory is up—why?”, this tells you whether it’s

too many completions,

too few sales,

or earlier starts that are now flowing through.

3) Normalization: how to make interrelated series comparable

These series are in different units and levels, so you need a common scale. Best options:

Option A (most intuitive): YoY % for flows + levels for stocks

Flows: YoY % for permits/starts/sales

Stocks: levels for under construction/inventory

Option B (best for lead/lag visuals): index to 100

Index permits/starts/sales to 100 at the same start date

You’ll see permits lead, starts lag, sales respond to rates.

Option C (most “quant”): z-scores

(Value – 5Y mean) / 5Y stdev
Great for regime detection, but less intuitive for casual viewing.

For your audience and use-case, A + a backlog ratio is usually the best.

4) Recommended “Pipeline module” layout for your dashboard
Tile 7: “SF Pipeline: permits → starts → sales”

Lines: permits, starts, sales (YoY % or indexed)

Small KPIs: latest YoY for each + “lead/lag” note (e.g., permits turning up first)

Tile 8: “Backlog & clearing”

Lines: under construction (level), inventory (level) or months supply

Bars: starts – completions, completions – sales (toggle)

KPI: under construction / sales (months of pipeline)

If you want just one tile: combine Tile 7 + 8 as a two-row tile.

5) Practical implementation note (Chart.js)

Chart.js doesn’t handle multi-panel charts in one canvas well without custom layout. The simplest approach is:

one “Pipeline” card containing two <canvas> elements, same controls and window.

This fits your current structure cleanly and avoids complex chart plugins.
